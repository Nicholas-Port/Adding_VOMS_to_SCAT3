# Adding_VOMS_to_SCAT3
This is the source code for our manuscript titled "Adding the Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening (VOMS) to the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) Improves Predictive Accuracy: An NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium Analysis"

This MATLAB source code is completely autmated.  It imports the original datafiles, stores post-processed data files, does all the analyses, and produced the publication figures.
Serious modifications will be required to make this code run on a different original datafile (eg. a FITBIR datafile).  The original datafiles being used here are from the NCAA/DOD CARE consortium for members of the consortium.
